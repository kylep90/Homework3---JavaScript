## Homework 3 - Generating Password
* I found this homework pretty challenging, especially finding a starting point.

* I had connected with another classmate and we worked on the initial parts of the code. This was very useful to discuss and share ideas and concepts.

* With research I was able to find new functions such as .split that splits a string. I got to use .concat in order to merge two or more variables together.

# What I enjoyed: 
After a lot of confusion as to why my code was not running the way I wanted, using console.log helped me identify these errors and guided me how to overcome them. Even though this was challenging I think I have enjoyed this homework the most (so far).

# What I would do next time:
Research or find a way not to repeat code. I believe some of this code could be made simplier by using a function or objects. I will look forward to seeing the solution to see a better method of completing this.

# Questions
* How do I make sure if the user wants a number in their password that it MUST contain a number? Currently the probablity of this happening is low.
* As mentioned before, what is the best way to limit the amount of repetitve code?
